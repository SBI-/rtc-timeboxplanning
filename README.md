## Idea and goal
This project delivers a new widget for RTC (Rational Team Concert) to allow iteration/sprint planning of work items in a *Tetris-Like* way. This was also the inspiriation for calling it **_Timebox Planning_**.

The widget is available as a serverside plugin, which can be installed on any RTC (CCM) instance.

## Compatibility
The Widget works for CLM V.4.0.3 and later. Currently it is in successful operation on V.6.0.3.
Since it is implemented process independently it supports the brand new SAFe template as well as any others including your customizations
