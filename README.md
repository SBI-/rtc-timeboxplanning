## Idea and goal
This project delivers a new widget for RTC (Rational Team Concert) to allow iteration/sprint planning of work items in a "Tetris-Like" way. 
We call it "Timebox Planning".

The widget is available as a serverside plugin, which can be installed on any RTC (CCM) instance.

It works for CLM V.4.0.3 and later. Currently it is in operation at my location on V.6.0.3
Since it is implemented generically it supports the brand new SAFe template as well as any others including your customizations

Today we offer you a binary distribution, which can be downloaded from this project and installed on your system. For license information see [License](LICENSE.md#license)

## Releases
Already buit versions of the RTC-Timeboxplanning can be found within the Releases section

## Support

Please Join this project, to file work items or to participate in the development of this great new tool.
